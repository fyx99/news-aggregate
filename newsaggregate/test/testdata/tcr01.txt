Dear Sophie, Can you please provide guidance and counsel for companies to support Ukrainian team members who are evacuating to the U.S.? Greatly appreciated! — Magnanimous VC Dear Magnanimous, The practice of immigration is subject to the ever-changing tides of geopolitical changes, and now, the battles in Ukraine. Ultimately, immigration is all about the human journey to freedom: We transcend border walls, the circumstances of our births, and current conditions (sometimes literally, sometimes figuratively) to cross through liminal spaces on our journeys to the birthright of actualizing our human potential. It’s easy to feel fear when we face the uncertainty of world events, including everything happening in Ukraine. One way to get out of our own heads and get back to listening to our hearts is through acts of service, by heeding the call to support one another to find safety, security and the freedom to live our dreams. Our actions seeded with love in the microcosm always support the macrocosm. Because of the flood of inquiries we’ve been receiving on the topic of Ukrainian immigration to the U.S., below are some guidelines for how U.S. founders, tech companies, and VCs can support Ukrainian citizens with U.S. immigration. Namaste, Sophie If you are temporarily moving your contractors to a third country from Ukraine and using your global payroll solution to temporarily employ them there, sponsor these workers for U.S. work visas to get them to the U.S. after their time in the third country. They may be able to apply for U.S. visas at the consulate in that third country. If you are considering H-1B, there are two main routes. The lottery is happening through March 18, 2022. You can petition for any qualified potential workers you would like to sponsor. Additionally, you can consider the cap-exempt H-1B option through a nonprofit such as Open Avenues. Then work with your immigration lawyer to obtain an unlimited number of H-1B worker visas at any time of year without the lottery. Ukrainian startup founders can consider options such as the O-1A for extraordinary ability, International Entrepreneur Parole, and the E-2 investor visa as Ukraine and the United States have a treaty of investment. Some people want to know if they can help Ukrainians with the EB-5 program, but the timing doesn’t really work for this because an EB-5 can take multiple years just to get the first approval. Therefore, starting an E-2 business might be a more effective short-term option and it can be followed by a variety of green card sponsorship pathways. Filing for asylum requires somebody to already be in the United States and to have experienced persecution or have a well-founded fear of persecution based on very narrow grounds. Even for somebody who qualifies, it can often take many years for their asylum case to get adjudicated, so asylum-seekers often feel like they are in limbo for a long time. Another option called Humanitarian Parole was heavily used by individuals fleeing Afghanistan in the summer of 2021. USCIS is extremely backlogged with these requests. Therefore, the priority – where possible — must be to find non-immigrant visa options where the USCIS petition permits premium processing. Have a question for Sophie? Ask it here.
